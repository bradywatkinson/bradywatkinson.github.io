Hi.

This is my personal website.

Whilst this is not my first iteration of a personal website, this is by far the prettiest one that I have ever made. On this page is some stuff from my first post, plus some additional information about me.

## About me

My name is Brady Watkinson

I graduated The University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia in 2015 with a double degree in Computer Science and Commerce (majoring in Information Systems). I was a Coop Scholar recipient (which basically means I had good grades in high school and I did a bunch of internships whilst I was at univeristy).

My main language is C++ but I am currently exploring web technologies and understanding web stacks. I have basic knowledge in Python Flask and some of the front end stuff, but it is still mostly new to me. I have also done a graphics course in OpenGL and **loved** it. I would love to work in this area.

My ideal job would be indie game development where each person in the team has a big part of all areas. [Superbrothers Sword and Sworcery](http://www.swordandsworcery.com/) changed my life (honestly one of the best games I have ever played) and since then, I have been slowly edging my way into game development, one project at a time. You can view my list of projects [here](/projects). I have also tonnes of non-game ideas which I have been working on recently.

## What to Expect

My goal of this website is to provide an outlet for me to share my thoughts and ideas, lessons learnt and maybe some helpful resources for people who are in a similar position to me.

What position is that I hear you ask? Well I am a recent software engineering graduate looking for a job. Thats it. 

As I am sure you are all aware, finding a job is one of the scariest things you can do in your life. The inherrent judging that takes place makes you wish either you already had a great job (made worse by the fact that your parents probably already do) or that you could never have a job in your life and just bum around. Well, you know the second one isn't an option, and you know you are capable of the first one; you have no excuse.
