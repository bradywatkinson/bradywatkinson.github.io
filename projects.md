## Curated Content - Fountain View

I am a regular [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) reader but I have noticed that the quality of the posts has significantly declined. I prefer posts about new technology, technology products, personal projects etc. These days economics, commercial products, world news and the like pervade the front page.

Fountain View is an alternative to Hacker News. It is based on the concept of content curration. Instead of popularity populating your front page, the eminent people you follow will. A reputable tech blogger may write one article a day, but they most certainly read dozens. Imagine if they selected the most intersting and created a feed, just for you. Combine that with people in different specialties or technologies and you have a recipe for interesting news. The beauty is, it can be applied to a variety of subject areas; bloggers can use it for a variety of channels, commentators can update their readers on multiple news sources, public figures can draw attention to important discourse.
