Following on from on creativity

All artwork is a shitty reflection of the perfect artwork.

Given an arbitary way of measuring "perfect", there exists a "perfect artistic work".
Any artistic work created is attempted to be the best possible representation of itself.

It follows, therefore, that any artistic work, is attempting to be the "perfect artistic work"
ANY artistic work is attemptinsg to be the "perfect artistic work"

All artwork is just a flawed version of the perfect artistic work
