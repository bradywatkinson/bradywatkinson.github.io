title: Converting technology to money
---

The 'Extended Technology Stack' is all the layers between the electricity flowing through a 'machine' and someone paying money.
The only reason for anything to exist is to create value. All value can be measured in money (whether their is liquidity in the
market is different). All the service providers, (think AWS, Hashicorp, Github) literally only make money because someone has
taken their product to the 'Technology Edge' 
'Technology' must be converted into 'Reality' through providing utility to persons. The 'Technology Edge' is the point of
contact between technology and real utility. All sorts of 'Edge Technologies' exist. Only the most efficient are rewarded (You
can imagine some threshold of conversion ratio which the technology must apply)
