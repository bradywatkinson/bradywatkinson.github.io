title: Infinite Greed

# Blockchain technology = infinite greed.

Feb 2017 - Market capitalisation of blockchain derivied currency tokens has exponentially increased. Why? Greed. If an actor
expects the price of a comodity to increase, it does not matter the price of the comodity, the rational action is to purchase
the comodity and sell when it has increased. The main caveat is that the comodity must be purchaseable i.e. the cost of a unit
must be less than the total amount of currency in circulation (i.e. the cost of one unit must be less than some arbitrary value
in which it can be 'purchased'). Blockchain technologies are essentially infinitely divisible (obviously not. we will get to
that latter). Because of this, there is no question of whether it is possible to buy a unit, an actor can just buy however
much of a unit they can afford. If a blockchain derived currency token is expected to go up, then there is nothing providing
an 'Absolute Limit' on the maximum price.

Obviously, there is a hard limit on how divisible a blockchain derived token is. In the case of 'Bitcoin', its value has a
precision of 10^-8 (aka a 'Satoshi'). At some point, a 'Bitcoin' could be so expensive that a single 'Satoshi' is worth more
than the total amount of currency. At this point, a seperate blockchain could come into existence which measures Sub-Satoshi's.
This new blockchain effectively doubles the life of 'Bitcoin'. It is not hard to see that this could propogate ad infinitum.

## Blockchain = Infinite Money

Thus, the cycle of "buying low" and "selling high" is infinitely sustainable. There is no upper limit on the price of a
blockchain currency. The current, seemingly unsustainable growth in blochain derived currency tokens which is a function of
human greed is actually infinitely sustainable. Greed has created the optimal outcome.

## Only the 'winning' blockchain = infinite money

Caveat One: Only the 'winning' blockchain will create infinite wealth. All other chains will tend to 0 relative to the
winning blockchain. Thus the question becomes whether it is possible to pick the winning blockchain? On a timeline marked
with 3 points, the creation of the first blockchain (the earliest time in which a candidate for the winning blockchain could
exist), Now, and Infinity:

Inception of Blockchain ---------------> Now ----------------------> Infinity

It must be more likely that any event occurs in the unbounded timesegment (infinity is really big). This means that more
likely, the 'winning' blockchain does not exist...

## Is it possible to 'hedge' on to the 'winning' blockchain?

Every new blockchain is a potential candidate for the 'winning' blockchain, which means one 'must' buy in to every new
blockchain (in practice, the process of a blockchain 'becoming' the winner and the previous one 'dying' must overlap by a
reasonable amount of time which means you don't need to buy in immediately). If there is a continuous creation of new
blockchains, one must continually sub-divide their wealth. Extrapolating, it must be such that they could reasonably
approach an 'indivisible amount' of wealth. At this point, an actor would effectively have to decide where to put the final
indivisible unit of their wealth into one blockchain or another. Seeing as it is possible' to select the wrong blockchain, it 
follows that it is impossible to infinitely hedge.

However, if a previous blockchain were to reach a limit of subdivision, then it must not be a candidate for the winning 
blockchain. In practice, this means as an actor approaches the limit of the subdivision of a blockchain derived token, the
token will either not be divisible, meaning the actor can EITHER safely move all their wealth from that blockchain to the new
blockchain, OR the current blockchain will become sufficiently divisible such that they can hedge onto the new blockchain.

If the previous blockchain were to BECOME divisible after one has 'divested' from it, the new divisibility can effectively be
treated as a new blockchain, and the same hedging process can be applied.
