title: Down the Rabbit Hole
---

Hi.

This is the first post on my new personal website Brady Watkinson dot com.

The title refers to the fact that I am primarily a C++ terminal programmer i.e I have no idea what I am doing with this website stuff; but it is never to late to learn.

My goal of this website is to provide an outlet for me to share my thoughts and ideas, lessons learnt and maybe some helpful resources for people who are in a similar position to me.

What position is that I hear you ask? Well I am a recent software engineering graduate looking for a job. Thats it.

As I am sure you are all aware, finding a job is one of the scariest things you can do in your life. The inherrent judging that takes place makes you wish either you already had a great job (made worse by the fact that your parents probably already do) or that you could never have a job in your life and just bum around. Well, you know the second one isn't an option, and you know you are capable of the first one; you have no excuse.
