If one can imagine a conceptual state of an imaginary "artistic work" (of any media). The transformation from one state to the
next is a (combinatorial explosion)[http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/CSP/ComputationalFinanceTeaching/CombinatorialExplosion.html]. A
brushstroke, a wave-dip, phrasing, color, light, motion, the ability to perceive all combinations is impossible, to even the
most advanced compuuter (mechanical or otherwise). 

The final product, thus, must be a "best efforts" outcome as a flawed human computer accesses and selects some subset of all
potential state transformations. Given infinite time, they could conceivably create the "perfect artistic work"

Essentially, the human computer is simply choosing the most pleasing state from some set of available states.

The combination of all states exists in and of itself and can be conceived individually. Creating a new state is a function of
all avalable imputs a human computer has. 

The human computer is able to filter out all unpleasing states immediately

Imagine a literary artistic work with no continuity. 


The creative process IS examining some subset of possible states and selecting one.
All persons can conceive all states INDIVIDUALLY
BUT EACH person can only evaluate ONE subset of possible states (with which they can create new states from)
  -> "conceivable creative subset (of all states)"
The size of ones "conceivable creative subset" is a function of all inputs they have ever experienced
