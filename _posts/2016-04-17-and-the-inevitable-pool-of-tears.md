...or how overwhelming internet technology really is.

So I have decided I wanted to start a project and I decided that I wanted it to be a web project.

The only previous experience I have had with web development was a relatively simple website called [DVJudge](https://dvjudge.stanleyhon.com/) built with a relatively simple framework ([Python Flask](https://flask.pocoo.org/)). Using the magic of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/), we were able to get our project up and running in two weeks and using a agile sprint methodology, out the door in 4. It was a lot of fun but I did notice some limitations of the technology used:

- The website was not responsive
- The database was very hard to maintain (we probably should have used [Alchemy...](https://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.1/))
- I like Python, but not that much
- Flask is not as universal

So I then decided I should do some research about web stuff, see what else is available.

I quickly came accross three main contenders, and a couple of hourse later, I had read the wikipedia articles for [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails), [Django](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)) and ["The Mean Stack"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)) (in the last case, the [individual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB) [pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express.js) of [each](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular.js) [compononent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)), some basic example code in each and perused stackoverflow for the communities opinion. I also had a quick look at [Seek.com](https://seek.com).

It seems start-ups like Ruby-on-Rails, bigger tech companies like Django and everyone else likes Javascript (including MEAN and various other subsets). This gave me a good idea of where to start looking and also and idea of what to expect with each stack.

At the moment, I am leaning towards Ruby-on-Rails because it seems to be the most popular and more widely used in the area tha I would be interested in (product-based start-ups) but I will reserve judgement until I get a chance to do the basica "Hello Server" for each.

The other major issue is templating and prettifying. I haven't had a chance to look into this, and I am not looking forward to it. Like many terminal programmers, fiddling with color schemes is not my idea fun.
